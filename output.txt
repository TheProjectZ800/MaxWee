India's income tax framework offers taxpayers the choice between two regimes: the Old Tax Regime and the New Tax Regime. Each has distinct tax slabs, deductions, and benefits. Here's a comprehensive overview to assist you in understanding the key differences and making an informed decision for the Financial Year (FY) 2024-2025.

Old Tax Regime:

The Old Tax Regime provides taxpayers with various exemptions and deductions, allowing them to reduce their taxable income through investments and eligible expenses.

Tax Slabs for FY 2024-2025:

Income up to ₹2.5 lakh: Nil
₹2.5 lakh to ₹5 lakh: 5%
₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh: 10%
₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh: 15%
₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh: 20%
₹12.5 lakh to ₹15 lakh: 25%
Above ₹15 lakh: 30%
Key Deductions Available:

Section 80C: Deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh for investments in instruments like Public Provident Fund (PPF), Employee Provident Fund (EPF), National Savings Certificates (NSC), Life Insurance Premiums, and Equity-Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS).
Section 80D: Deductions for health insurance premiums:
Up to ₹25,000 for self, spouse, and dependent children.
Additional ₹25,000 for parents below 60 years; ₹50,000 if parents are above 60.
Section 24(b): Deduction of up to ₹2 lakh on home loan interest for a self-occupied property.
Standard Deduction: ₹50,000 for salaried individuals.
New Tax Regime:

Introduced to simplify the tax structure, the New Tax Regime offers lower tax rates but does not allow most exemptions and deductions available under the Old Tax Regime.

Revised Tax Slabs for FY 2024-2025:

Income up to ₹3 lakh: Nil
₹3 lakh to ₹7 lakh: 5%
₹7 lakh to ₹10 lakh: 10%
₹10 lakh to ₹12 lakh: 15%
₹12 lakh to ₹15 lakh: 20%
Above ₹15 lakh: 30%
Key Features:

Standard Deduction: Increased to ₹75,000 for salaried employees.
Rebate under Section 87A: Individuals with income up to ₹7 lakh are eligible for a rebate, making their tax liability zero.
No other exemptions or deductions: Most of the deductions available under the Old Tax Regime, such as those under Sections 80C, 80D, and 24(b), are not available.
Comparison and Tax Calculation:

To illustrate the impact of both regimes, let's consider an individual with a gross annual income of ₹10 lakh.

Under the Old Tax Regime:

Gross Income: ₹10,00,000
Less: Standard Deduction: ₹50,000
Less: Section 80C Deductions: ₹1,50,000
Less: Section 80D Deductions: ₹25,000
Taxable Income: ₹7,75,000
Tax Calculation:

Up to ₹2.5 lakh: Nil
₹2.5 lakh to ₹5 lakh (₹2.5 lakh @ 5%): ₹12,500
₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh (₹2.5 lakh @ 10%): ₹25,000
₹7.5 lakh to ₹7.75 lakh (₹25,000 @ 15%): ₹3,750
Total Tax Payable: ₹41,250

Under the New Tax Regime:

Gross Income: ₹10,00,000
Less: Standard Deduction: ₹75,000
Taxable Income: ₹9,25,000
Tax Calculation:

Up to ₹3 lakh: Nil
₹3 lakh to ₹7 lakh (₹4 lakh @ 5%): ₹20,000
₹7 lakh to ₹9.25 lakh (₹2.25 lakh @ 10%): ₹22,500
Total Tax Payable: ₹42,500

Conclusion:

In this scenario, the Old Tax Regime results in a slightly lower tax liability due to the available deductions. However, the best choice between the Old and New Tax Regimes depends on individual circumstances, including income level, eligible deductions, and financial goals. Taxpayers should evaluate both regimes annually to determine which offers greater tax benefits based on their specific situation.
